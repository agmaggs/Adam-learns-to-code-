# Adam-learns-to-code-
These are the larger completed exercises I have created while learning to code. 
I am an Atlanta area waiter trying to create a massive change in my life. After hearing about the #learntocode controversy I figured I would take the challenge. In early November 2019 I used StackSkills to purchase a suite of bootcamps and 101s. I'm excited and intimidated by the road ahead.
At present, the plan is to learn the basics of the common languages. Once I have a better understanding I will select a language to focus on. There is pretty much only one criteria I will use to select that language: which language will get me paid well and quickly? Presently I suspect it will be Python.
